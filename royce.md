# Character Background

## Royce “Ironbeard” Theodore
"For you, as a dwarf, you arrived with the dwarven delegation
under Manistrad Copperlocks. She is the leader of the miners in the region and
she and her dwarfs are here by royal decree and you accompanied them on their
journey there, for why you followed them, that’s up to you."

“Royce” and “Theodore” are not typical dwarven name. As such, Royce
“Ironbeard” Theodore was no ordinary dwarf. His true parents and dwarven
lineage are a mystery. A young pair of human aristocrats had discovered baby
Royce swaddled in cloth and carefully deposited next to a river. A medallion in
the shape of an iron beard was and remains the only possession that offers any
clue to Royce’s lineage.

A dwarf raised by loving human parents, Royce learned to speak the common
tongue naturally and with the sophisticated accent of human aristocrats. Where
they could not teach him dwarven customs and traditions, his parents employed
dwarven tutors. Therefore, Royce is fluent in the dwarven tongue, although he
speaks with a queer human accent; and is proficient in the brewing and stone
cutting traditions.

Young Royce excelled at athletics, and his feats of dwarven strength and
endurance drew crowds of awed aristocrats, courtiers, and commoners. And
despite his dwarven stature and obviously foreign heritage, Royce had a
way of winning over friends and charming people.

However, book learning is not his forte, Royce prefered to spend time at
temples, praying and breathing the inspirational sermons of the clerics. At
a young age, he nurtured a strong sense of spirituality, justice, right and
wrong.

Royce’s brother Philip was notably the opposite. Philip overbearing intellect
and sharp tongue quickly alienated would-be friends. Phlip resented his
brother’s popularity, and considered Royce an “unwanted bumbling idiot dwarf
with no value to society”.

One moonless evening, Royce’s poor judgement, or perhaps divine inspiration,
compelled him to venture into an unguarded forest. With heightened dwarven
vision, he could clearly make out the shapes of bandits stabbing a traveler.
Throwing discretion to the wind, Royce grabbed at the heaviest stick and
charged the bandits. Expecting an army, the bandits fled from fear. During the
exchange, the traveler had been critically wounded. Thinking of the temple
clerics, Royce prayed and prayed for divine intervention; and to both their
surprise Royce’s hands glowed of restorative energy which healed the traveler.

The traveler spread word of Royce’s valor and miraculous act healing. Royce’s
parents were proud, his brother jealous, and the clerics were not sure how to
interpret this seemingly divine miracle. Searching through all their books,
they found one similar occurrence of valor and miracles. It happened to
a half-elf almost two hundred years ago. The cleric’s convinced Royce to travel
to meet with the half-elf, who had reportedly retired in Saltmarsh.

On the way to Saltmarsh, Royce met up with a travelling group of dwarven
miners. They consider him something of an interesting oddity yet oddly
inspirational character. Their leader, Manistrad Copperlocks has allowed Royce
to travel with them to Saltmarsh.
