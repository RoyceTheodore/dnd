### Exploring the Cavern
We begin inside the mansion over the body of a dead illusionist wizard. We
discover a few items: magic scale armor of swimming, a magic pipe, and a set of
loaded dice. Magpie swipes the loaded dice.

Magpie and Lance remain in the barracks, and vehemently argue with eachother
for the entire episode.

While exploring the basement caverns, we discover bolts of cloth, kegs of brandy,
and other stolen goods. We encounter two hobgoblins in front of a large
row-boat. After combat, the party retreats back to the barracks to rest.

### Marianius Murders Ren
While the party sleeps, Ren insults and flicks Marianius in the nose, calling
him a "sea dog". Marianius shape-shifts into a bear and violently mauls Ren.
The party slumbers through the altercation. Marianius watches, composed and
apathetic, as Ren bleeds out and dies.

The party awaken to discover Ren's corpse. Royce is appalled at sight of his
murdered comrade. Believing he would be unable to apprehend Marianius, Royce
exiles him from the party.

Without Marianus, the party loads the boat with the stolen goods and Ren's
corpse. Despite possessing no knowledge of sailing or navigation, the party
somehow manages to row back to town.

After a brief talk with the harbor master and the city guard, the party
sells the boat and receives a total reward of 300gp. Tired, the party returns to
rest at the Wicker Goat, except for the two Tieflings who go to the Faithful
Quartermaster of Ayus.

### Ren's Grave and a Bar Fight
The next morning, while out for a stroll, Vatu stumbles upon the graveyards,
where he witnesses an undertaker bury Ren into an unmarked grave. Suddenly
overcome by a responsibility to not have his former companion's name forgotten,
Vatu uses magic to temporarily inscribe "Ren" onto the tombstone.

On his return travel from a shop, Royce encounters the half-orc Bosu and the
winged Sky. Enraptured by Bosu muscular physics, Royce invites Bosu to
drinks and challenges arm-wrestle.

The three travel to a bar on the dockside: The Empty Net. Kreb Shanker,
the barkeep, serves up an especially exotic and expensive brandy.
Uncharacteristic for a dwarf, Royce becomes quickly intoxicated. After
becoming the arm-wrestle champion, Bosu overhears a customer insult him,
claiming he arm-wrestles like a girl. Bosu decks the customer.

A bar fight ensues. Bosu satisfyingly clobbers many people, while a drunken
Royce punches air and repeatedly falls to the ground. Kreb attempts to
regain control of the situation, but Sky casts a thunderwave spell that 
electrocutes six patrons.

The armed city guard enter the bar, question everyone, and arrest Sky.

Sky is shackled, and carted off to jail. He is charged with 6 counts of murder,
and sentenced to 60 years of hard labor.
